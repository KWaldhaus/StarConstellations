# Star Constellations

Small processing programm creating a random star constellation with real stars.
The star data is taken from the Hipparcos catalogue (http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/239#sRM2.1).

Each star is drawn at their relative position if the data is complete. Their star color is included too.
The time can be accelerated to show their relative movement over the years on the nightsky.
